# RAG-powered Chatbot for PDF Document

## Introduction
This project involves creating a RAG-powered chatbot that answers questions based on a given PDF document. The provided PDF is a car insurance policy booklet. The task includes extracting text, creating a dataset, implementing the RAG model, evaluating its performance, and developing a front-end interface.

## Dataset Construction
The dataset consists of 30 diverse query-response pairs extracted from different sections of the PDF. This ensures coverage across various topics, providing a comprehensive test for the chatbot.

## Evaluation Metrics
We used BLEU and ROUGE scores to measure the accuracy of the model. These metrics compare the similarity of generated responses to the ground truth responses.

## Improving Accuracy
- Fine-tuned the model with the created dataset.
- Experimented with different hyperparameters.
- Used data augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity.

## Front-End Development
We used Streamlit to create a simple web interface where users can input queries and receive responses from the chatbot.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to develop a RAG-powered chatbot, highlighting skills in NLP, model fine-tuning, and front-end development.
